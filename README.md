# cs205-efrosfreeman

The parallel implementation of the Efros-Freeman algorithm for image quilting
can be run with:

```sh
python driver_parallel.py
```

The input sample image can be changed by altering the `image_name` variable in
the drivers. Patch size and overlap size can be adjusted similarly.

Comprehensive documentation can be found on the this repo's GitHub pages.
